This repository contains information about the the Eclipse Kuksa project and available hardware.
It includes hardware schematics and manufacturing files, housing details for 3D printers, as
well as a setup guide. Please use the links below to one of the manuals.

## Eclipse Kuksa Retrofit Dongle

While [Eclipse Kuksa](https://www.eclipse.org/kuksa/) cares about to interconnect
vehicles with external services, typically vehicles already on the road do not
provide any mechanisms to install software afterwards. The Eclipse Kuksa prototyping
platform describes a retrofit solution for already existing vehicles. It can be
directly connected to the in-vehicle OBD II interface. The platform combines a
Raspberry Pi Compute Module, several options to communicate information
(e.g., via cellular or WiFi connectivity) and access to OBD. The most important
information can be accessed in the links below.
